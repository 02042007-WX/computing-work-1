# a cheesy love story 

  His brown chocolate eyes, the way he sweeps his hair to the side and his laugh... 
I swear, he is going to be the death of me. 
How can one be so perfect?

I have never fallen this hard before... 
This boy must really have a huge effect on me.

I should probably pay attention to his words instead of his face. 

  After school, while walking to the train station, I was lost in my sea of thoughts. 
"Hey," a voice came from behind me, followed by a tap on my shoulder. 
Turning around, I realised it was him, Jackson, the guy I am head over heels for.
