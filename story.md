# a cheesy love story 

  His brown chocolate eyes, the way he sweeps his hair to the side and his laugh... 
I swear, he is going to be the death of me. 
How can one be so perfect? 
He is so funny, smart and kind. 
What is this boy doing to me? 
I have never fallen this hard before... 
This boy must really have a huge effect on me.


  "Renee? Are you still there?" Jackson questioned.

  "Sorry, spaced out for a moment," I replied. 
That was close. 
I should probably pay attention to his words instead of his face. 

  After school, while walking to the train station, I was lost in my sea of thoughts. 
"Hey," a voice came from behind me, followed by a tap on my shoulder. 
Turning around, I realised it was him, Jackson, the guy I am head over heels for. 

  "So..." Jackson started. "Do you know what kind of guys Jessica likes? I mean, she's you're best friend after all." 
Upon hearing those words, my heart shattered into a million pieces. 
He liked my best friend, not me...

  "Yeah, she likes tall and witty guys," I lied, hoping that he would fall for it. 

   "Oh, okay, thanks, Renee! Bye!" Jackson replied with a smile. 
  I could obviously hear the tinge of sadness in his voice.
