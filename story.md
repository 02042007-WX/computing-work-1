# a cheesy love story 

*Renee POV* 

  His brown chocolate eyes, the way he sweeps his hair to the side and his laugh... 
I swear, he is going to be the death of me. 
How can one be so perfect? 
He is so funny, smart and kind. 
What is this boy doing to me? 
I have never fallen this hard before... 
This boy must really have a huge effect on me.


  "Renee? Are you still there?" Jackson questioned.

  "Sorry, spaced out for a moment," I replied. 
That was close. 
I should probably pay attention to his words instead of his face. 

  After school, while walking to the train station, I was lost in my sea of thoughts. 
"Hey," a voice came from behind me, followed by a tap on my shoulder. 
Turning around, I realised it was him, Jackson, the guy I am head over heels for. 

  "So..." Jackson started. "Do you know what kind of guys Jessica likes? I mean, she's you're best friend after all." 
Upon hearing those words, my heart shattered into a million pieces. 
He likes my best friend, not me... 
I guess this is where everything in life goes downhill just like those in the books that I read.

  "Yeah, she likes tall and witty guys," I lied, hoping that he would fall for it. 

  "Oh, okay, thanks, Renee! Bye!" Jackson replied with a smile. 
I could obviously hear the tinge of sadness in his voice. 
He probably thought that he did not classify as a guy that Jessica would like. 
Maybe I should give up on this stupid crush. 
But how could I, he has everything I want in a guy. 
The fact that I cannot get him makes me like him even more. 
Why am I reacting this way? 
I should probably tell Jessica that Jackson likes her. 

*Jackson POV* 

She is so focused, the way she scrunches her eyes as she thinks of ideas for our project, and her tiny giggles whenever I crack a lame joke. 
All those traits just maker her seem... *perfect*
